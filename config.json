"I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair spreading his hands on the multitude there a man who cried for a love gone stale and ice cold hearts of charity bare. I watched as fear took the old men's gaze, hopes of the young in troubled graves. I see no day, I heard him say, so grey is the face of every mortal.",
"Oh, oh, people of the earth: listen to the warning, the prophet he said. For soon the cold of night will fall summoned by your own hand.",
"Oh, oh, children of the land! Quicken to the new life, take my hand. Fly and find the new green bough--return like the white dove.",
"He told of death as a bone white haze, taking the lost and the unloved babe. Late, too late, all the wretches run, these kings of beasts now counting their days. From mother's love is the son estranged, married his own, his precious gain. The earth will shake in two will break, and death all around will be your dow'ry!",
"Flee for your life! Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you fear for your life, deceive you not the fires of hell will take you should death await you.",
"God give you grace to purge this place and peace all around may be your fortune.",
"Oh, oh, children of the land: love is still the answer, take my hand! The vision fades, a voice I hear: 'Listen to the Madman!'",
"Love of my life--you've hurt me, you've broken my heart and now you leave me, love of my life can't you see--bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me, because you don't know what it means to me. Love of my life don't leave me, you've taken my love, you now desert me, love of my life can't you see--bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.",
"When this is blown over and everything's all by the way--when I get older, I will be there at your side to remind you how I still love you--still love you.",
"Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality--open your eyes, look up to the skies and see...",
"I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy--because I'm easy come, easy go, a little high, little low, anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me...",
"Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun, but now I've gone and thrown it all away.",
"Too late, my time has come, sends shivers down my spine--body's aching all the time. Goodbye everybody - I've got to go--gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.",
"I see a little silhouetto of a man, scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the Fandango?",
"So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye? So you think you can love me and leave me to die? Oh baby--can't do this to me baby! Just gotta get out--just gotta get right outta here!",
"Nothing really matters, anyone can see, nothing really matters--nothing really matters to me...anyway the wind blows…",
"Get your party gown, get your pigtail down, get your heart beatin', baby! Got my timin' right, got my act all tight--it's gotta be tonight my little schoolbabe.",
"Tie your Mother down, lock your Daddy out of doors--I don't need him nosin' around! Tie your Mother down, tie your Mother down--give me all your love tonight!",
"Your mamma and your Daddy gonna plague me till I die--why can't they understand I'm just a peace lovin' guy?",
"Look into my eyes and you'll see I'm the only one. You've captured my love, stolen my heart, changed my life. Everytime you make a move, you destroy my mind. And the way you touch...I lose control and shiver deep inside. You take my breath away.",
"You can reduce me to tears with a single sigh. Every breath that you take--any sound that you make is a whisper in my ear. I could give up all my life for just one kiss--I would surely die if you dismiss me from your love. You take my breath away.",
"So please don't go--don't leave me here all by myself. I get ever so lonely from time to time. I will find you anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you, right until the ends of the earth. I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you...that you just take my breath away.",
"Did we leave our way behind us, such a long long way behind us--who knows when, now who knows where, where the light of day will find us?",
"Bring out the charge of the love brigade--there is spring in the air once again! Drink to the sound of the song parade, there is music and love everywhere. Give a little love to me, take a little love from me, I want to share it with you--I feel like a millionaire.",
"Once we were mad, we were happy, we spent all our days holding hands together. Do you remember, my love, how we danced and played; in the rain we laid, could stay there, forever and ever...now I am sad, you are so far away, I sit counting the hours day by day--come back to me, how I long for your love...",
"Music is playing in the darkness and a lantern goes swinging by--shadows flickering, my heart's jittering, just you and I!",
"Laughter ringing in the darkness, people drinking for days gone by--time don't mean a thing when you're by my side. Please stay a while.",
"You know I never could foresee the future years, you know I never could see where life was leading me--but will we be together for ever? What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know?",
"I can hear the music in the darkness floating softly to where to lie--no more questions now, let's enjoy tonight, just you and I.",
"Can anybody find me somebody to love?",
"Each morning I get up I die a little, can barely stand on my feet, take a look in the mirror and cry--Lord, what you're doing to me! I have spent all my years in believing you, but I just can't get no relief, Lord!",
"I work hard every day of my life, I work till I ache my bones. At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own--I get down on my knees and I start to pray till the tears run down from my eyes: Lord--somebody, somebody, can anybody find me somebody to love?",
"Everyday I try and I try and I try, but everybody wants to put me down, they say I'm goin' crazy, they say I got a lot of water in my brain, got no common sense. I got nobody left to believe!",
"Got no feel, I got no rhythm, I just keep losing my beat. I'm OK, I'm alright, ain't gonna face no defeat. I just gotta get out of this prison cell--someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!",
"I'm a simple man with a simple name. From this soil my people came, in this soil remain.",
"White man, white man--don't you see the light behind your blackened skies?",
"White man, white man--where you gonna hide from the hell you've made?",
"Leave my body in shame, leave my soul in disgrace, but by every God's name, say your prayers for your race!",
"What is left of your dream? Just the words on your stone: a man who learned how to teach, then forgot how to learn.",
"I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things, we can do the tango just for two. I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings, be your Valentino just for you!",
"Ooh love--oooh Loverboy! What're you doin' tonight, hey boy? Set my alarm, turn on my charm, that's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy!",
"Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster), ooh, ooh, let me feel your love heat! Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love and tell me how do you feel right after-all I'd like for you and I to go romancing. Say the word--your wish is my command.",
"When I'm not with you, I think of you always. I miss you--I miss those long hot summer nights. When I'm not with you, think of me always. I love you--love you.",
"Hey boy where do you get it from? Hey boy where did you go? I learned my passion in the good old-fashioned school of loverboys.",
"Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely. I will pay the bill, you taste the wine. Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely--just take me back to yours that will be fine. (Come on and get it!)",
"Everything's all right, just hold on tight--that's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy.",
"When I'm gone, don't stop to wonder if I ever think of you. The same moon shines, the same wind blows for both of us, and time is but a paper moon...be not gone.",
"Though I'm gone, it's just as though I hold the flower that touches you. A new life grows, the blossom knows there's no one else could warm my heart as much as you...be not gone.",
"Let us cling together as the years go by. Oh my love, my love, in the quiet of the night let our candle always burn. Let us never lose the lessons we have learned. Teo Torriatte konomama, iko aisuruhito yo, shizukana yoi ni hikario tomoshi, itoshiki oshieo idaki.",
"Hear my song--still think of me the way you've come to think of me. The nights grow long, but dreams live on. Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me...dream on.",
"Buddy you're a boy make a big noise playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day! You got mud on yo' face, you big disgrace, kickin' your can all over the place!",
"Buddy you're a young man hard man shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world some day. You got blood on yo' face, you big disgrace, wavin' your banner all over the place!",
"Buddy you're an old man poor man pleadin' with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day you got mud on your face you big disgrace somebody gonna put you back in your place!",
"I've paid my dues time after time--I've done my sentence, but committed no crime. And bad mistakes--I've made a few. I've had my share of sand kicked in my face, but I've come through! We are the champions, my friends, and we'll keep on fighting till the end.",
"I've taken my bows and my curtain calls--you brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it...I thank you all.",
"I consider it a challenge before the whole human race, and I ain't gonna lose!",
"Spread your little wings and fly away--fly away, far away. Pull yourself together 'cos you know you should do better. That's because you're a free man.",
"Since he was small, had no luck at all, nothing came easy to him. Now it was time, he'd made up his mind: 'This could be my last chance.'",
"You take my body--I give you heat. You say you're hungry--I give you meat. I suck your mind--you blow my head. Make love...inside your bed. Everybody get down, make love.",
"Everytime I get hot, you wanna cool down. Everytime I get high, you say you wanna come down. You say it's enough, in fact it's too much, everytime I get a, get down, get down, make love.",
"I can squeeze--you can shake me. I can feel--when you break me. Come on so heavy when you take me--you make love, you make love, you make love, you make love, you can make everybody get down make love.",
"I make it half past six you come at seven, always trying to keep me hanging round. You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting, never contemplating my point of view. This comes as no surprise--I'm a fool, for I believed your lies. But now I've seen through your disguise--who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?",
"Oh, I believed you, went on my knees to you, how I trusted you, but you turned me down! But it's dog eat dog in this rat race and it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face, reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand. Where is that helping hand?",
"Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back--there's an empty feeling that you can't forget reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand",
"When I met you, you were always charming, couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine. You were oh so so sophisticated, never interested in what I'd say. I had to swallow my pride, so naive, you took me for a ride, but now I'm the one to decide: who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?",
"You say you love me and I hardly know your name. And if I say I love you in the candle light, there's no-one but myself to blame. But there's something inside that's turning my mind away--oh how I could love you if I could let you stay.",
"It's late--and I'm bleeding deep inside. It's late--is it just my sickly pride? Too late--even now the feeling seems to slip away. So late--though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say: It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late.",
"The way you love me is the sweetest love around, but after all this time, the more I'm trying, the more I seem to let you down.",
"Oh, you know that I can love you, though I know I can't be true--oh, you made me love you, don't tell me that we're through.",
"If I take you tonight, is it making my life a lie? Oh, you make me wonder--did I live my life alright?",
"Too late--so let the fire take our bodies this night. So late--so let the waters take our guilt in the tide. It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's late, it's all too late.",

"Are you ready, are you ready for this? Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?",
"How do you think I'm going to get along, without you when you're gone? You took me for everything that I had, and kicked me out on my own. Are you happy, are you satisfied? How long can you stand the heat?",
"There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man and bring him to the ground: you can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad and leave him when he's down. But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you, I'm standing on my own two feet.",
"You promised me, you'd keep in touch--I read your letter and it hurt me so much. I said I'd never, never be angry with you.",

"A little bit attention--you got it! Need some affection--you got it.",
"It started off so well--they said we made a perfect pair. I clothed myself in your glory and your love--how I loved you, how I cried! The years of care and loyalty were nothing but a sham, it seems. The years belie we lived the lie: 'I love you 'til I die.'",

"You stand so tall, you don't frighten me at all!",
"Just give me your body, give me your body--don't talk.",
"This street, honey, is a mean street--living in this street honey needs a mean streak. We've got criminals living in this street, but there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping like a jukebox playing the same dead record or a radio in the corner keeps blaring--I got a feeling, this world is using me.",
"This town, honey, is a dead town; living in this town, honey, is a let-down, coming to this town, honey, is a showdown, but there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel--still there's a feeling, this world is using me.",

"They called him a hero in the land of the free, but he wouldn't shake my hand, boy--he disappointed me. So I got my handgun and I blew him away--that critter was a bad guy, I had to make him pay.",
"You might fear for my reason; I don't care what they say. Look out, baby, it's the season for the mad masquerade!",
"I've been told it's the fashion to let me on the streets again--it's nothing but a crime of passion, and I'm not to blame.",
"You know a gun never killed nobody--you can ask anyone. People get shot by people...people with guns!",
"Guilt stains on my pillow, blood on my terraces, torsos in my closet, shadows from my past: life is real.",
"Sleeping is my leisure, waking up in a minefield. Dream is just a pleasure dome, love is a roulette wheel--life is real.",
"Success is my breathing space--I brought it on myself. I will price it, I will cash it, I can take it or leave it.",
"Calling all boys, calling all girls, calling all people on streets around the world--take this message, a message for you. This message is old, yeah, this message is true. This message is love.",
"Take a message of love far and near; take a message of love for all to hear.",
"Some sleepless nights in wait for you, some foreign presence you feel, comes creeping through. Some stream of hope the whole world through spread like some silent disease--you'll get yours too.",
"Don't touch me now, don't hold me now, don't break the spell, darling, now you are near.",
"Las palabras de amor--let me hear the words of love. Despacito mi amor--love me slow and gently.",
"One foolish world, so many souls senselessly hurled through the never ending cold, and all for fear, and all for greed...speak any tongue but for God's sake we need las palabras de amor--let me hear the words of love.",
"This room is bare, this night is cold, we're far apart and I'm growing old, but while we live, we'll meet again, so then my love we may whisper once more: it's you I adore.",
"You're a cool cat, coming on strong with all the chit-chat, you're alright.",
"You were wishing and hoping and waiting to really hit the big time, but did it happen, happen, no! You're speeding too fast--slow down, slow down, you'd better slow down.",
"Pressure pushing down on me, pressing down on you, no man ask for. Under pressure--that burns a building down, splits a family in two, puts people on streets.",
"It's the terror of knowing what this world is about: watching some good friends screaming let me out!",
"Chippin' around--kick my brains around the floor. These are the days it never rains but it pours.",
"Can't we give ourselves one more chance? Why can't we give love that one more chance?",
"Cause love's such an old fashioned word, and love dares you to care for the people on the edge of the night, and love dares you to change our way of caring about ourselves. This is our last dance, this is our last dance, this is ourselves under pressure.",
"I'd sit alone and watch your light--my only friend through teenage nights, and everything I had to know, I heard it on my radio. You gave them all those old time stars through wars of worlds invaded by Mars. You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry, you made us feel like we could fly.",
"You had your time, you had the power; you've yet to have your finest hour.",
"Let's hope you never leave, old friend; like all good things, on you we depend.",
"Give me your mind, baby, give me your body--give me some time, baby, let's have a party.",
"I love you cos you're sweet and I love you cos you're naughty--I love you for your mind but give me your body. I wanna be a toy at your birthday party!",
"I don't want my freedom--there's no reason for living with a broken heart.",
"It's a hard life to be true lovers together, to love and live forever in each other's hearts--it's a long hard fight to learn to care for each other, to trust in one another right from the start, when you're in love.",
"Life is tough on your own. Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies, waiting for love.",
"In a world that's filled with sorrow there are people searching for love in every way.",
"I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love. Yes I did it for love, for love--oh, I did it for love.",
"I'm gonna talk a little walk on the wild side, I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas, I'm gonna get me some action, go crazy, driving in the fast lane.",
"You better watch out--I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble. So look out--look out, I'm a man on the prowl.",
"I don't wanna be a rock'n'roll steady--I just wanna be low down trash.",
"It's a Machine's world--don't tell me I ain't got no soul!",
"When the machines take over, it ain't no place for rock'n'roll.",
"They freeze me, they burn me, they squeeze me, they stress me, with smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me, but no-one, but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away--back to Humans.",
"What's that Machine noise? It's bytes and megachips for tea. It's that Machine, boys, with Random Access Memory!",
"It's software, it's hardware, its heartbeat is time-share. Its midwife's a disk drive, its sex-life is quantised. It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.",
"Living in a new world, thinking in the past. Living in a new world--how you gonna last?",
"I want to break free from your lies, you're so self satisfied, I don't need you--I've got to break free.",
"I've fallen in love for the first time and this time I know it's for real.",
"It's strange but it's true--I can't get over the way you love me like you do, but I have to be sure when I walk out that door, oh, how I want to be free, baby.",
"This is the only life for me--surround myself around my own fantasy. You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself, forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.",
"Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world? When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure, wake up screaming in the middle of the night, you think it's all been a waste of time, it's been a bad year.",
"Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend? Without a job and no money to spend, you're a stranger.",
"That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside--you keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end. Oh, get yourself together! Things are looking better everyday.",
"Here we stand or here we fall--history won't care at all. Make the bed, light the light; Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.",
"Oh every night, and every day, a little piece of you is falling away, but lift your face, the Western Way--build your muscles as your body decays.",
"Toe your line and play their game--let the anaesthetic cover it all till one day they call your name--you know it's time for the Hammer to Fall.",
"Lock your door but rain is pouring through your window pane--baby, now your struggle's all vain.",
"For we who grew up tall and proud in the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud, convinced our voices can't be heard--we just wanna scream it louder and louder: what the hell we fighting for? Just surrender and it won't hurt at all. You just got time to say your prayers while you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.",
"Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed; take a look at all the suffering we breed. So many lonely faces scattered all around, searching for what they need.",
"Is this the world we created? What did we do it for? Is this the world we invaded against the law?",
"If there's a God in the sky looking down, what can he think of what we've done to the world that He created?",
"One man  one goal  one mission, one heart  one soul  just one solution, one flash  of light  yeah one god one vision.",
"One flesh  one bone, one true religion, one voice  one hope, one real decision, wowowowo  gimme one vision.",
"No wrong  no right, I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white, no blood  no stain, all we need is  one world wide vision.",
"I had a dream, when I was young, a dream of sweet illusion, a glimpse of hope and unity, and visions of one sweet union, but a cold wind blows, and a dark rain falls, and in my heart it shows, look what they've done to my dream!",
"So give me your hands, give me your hearts, I'm ready! There's only one direction--one world  one nation, yeah, one vision.",
"Gimme one night, gimme one hope, just gimme one man  one man, one bar  one night, one day  hey hey, just gimme  gimme  gimme fried chicken.",
"One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal one golden glance of what should be--it's a kind of magic, one shaft of light that shows the way, no mortal man can win this day.",
"The bell that rings inside your mind is challenging the doors of time.",
"This rage that lasts a thousand years will soon be done.",
"This flame that burns inside of me, I'm hearing secret harmonies--it's a kind of magic.",
"Just one year of love is better than a lifetime alone. One sentimental moment in your arms is like a shooting star right through my heart.",
"My heart cries out to your heart--I'm lonely but you can save me. My hand reaches out for your hand--I'm cold but you light the fire in me.",
"Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, oh yeah, sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life.",
"When I was young and just getting started and people talked to me they sounded broken hearted, then I grew up and got my imagination, and all I wanted was to start a new relation--so in love but love had a bad reaction, I was looking for some good old satisfaction, but pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection.",
"When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light, but inside of your mind you have to put up a fight--where are the answers that we're all searching for? There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore.",
"Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face, for better for worse, so let's make the best of our years.",
"It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust--friends will be friends; when you're in need of love they give you care and attention. Friends will be friends--when you're through with life and all hope is lost, hold out your hand, cos friends will be friends right till the end.",
"There's no time for us, there's no place for us--what is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us?",
"There's no chance for us--it's all decided for us. This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.",
"Who wants to live forever? Who dares to love forever when love must die?",
"Here I am, I'm the master of your destiny! I am the one, the only one, I am the god of kingdom come--gimme the prize, just gimme the prize!",
"Give me your kings, let me squeeze them in my hands--your puny princes, your so-called leaders of your land. I'll eat them whole before I'm done, the battle's fought and the game is won.",
"Remember, love's stronger, remember, love walks tall--don't lose your heart.",
"Here we are. Born to be kings. We're the princes of the universe. Here we belong. Fighting to survive in a world with the darkest powers.",
"I am immortal. I have inside me blood of kings. I have no rival. No man can be my equal. Take me to the future of your world!",
"I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand!",
"No man could understand: my power is in my own hand.",
"I'm a man that will go far--fly the moon and reach for the stars. With my sword and head held high, got to pass the test first time--yeah!",
"We had a good night jamming away--there was a full moon showing and we started to play, but in the cold light of day next morning, party was over, the party was over.",
"We got love and we got style, and we got sex and I know, I know we got what it takes--oh, oh, why don't you come back and play?",
"Who said that my party was all over, huh, huh? I'm in pretty good shape.",
"This one's on me so let us do it just right--this here one party don't get started 'till midnight.",
"Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all--it's a miracle. All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal, that's a miracle. Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone--it's a miracle.",
"The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth - an end to war, it's a miracle we need - the miracle, the miracle we're all waiting for today.",
"If every leaf on every tree could tell a story that would be a miracle; if every child on every street had clothes to wear and food to eat, that's a miracle. If all God's people could be free to live in perfect harmony, it's a miracle, we're having a miracle on earth.",
"Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea, super powers always fighting, but Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling--it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle.",
"Adventure seeker on an empty street, just an alley creeper, light on his feet--a young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt, with the pain and anger can't see a way out. It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say, gotta find me a future--move out of my way.",
"Listen all you people, come gather round. I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground. Just give me what I know is mine--people, do you hear me? Just give me the sign.",
"It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth: here's to the future for the dreams of youth!",
"When you hear a sound that you just can't place, feel somethin' move that you just can't trace, when something sits on the end of your bed--don't turn around when you hear me tread. I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man--incredible how you can see right through me.",
"Never had a real good friend--not a boy or a girl. No-one knows what I've been through--let my flag unfurl. So I make my mark from the edge of the world...",
"When love breaks up, when the dawn light wakes up, a new life is born. Somehow I have to make this final breakthru...Now!",
"I wake up, feel just fine--your face fills my mind. I get religion quick 'cos you're looking divine.",
"Breakthru these barriers of pain--breakthru to the sunshine from the rain, make my feelings known towards you, turn my heart inside and out for you now...",
"Honey, you're starting something deep inside of me; honey you're sparking something, this fire in me. I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy!",
"You lead a fairy tale existence but into every life a little rain must fall.",
"You want a clean reputation, but now you're facing complications, 'cos into every life a little rain must fall.",
"Scandal--now you've left me, all the world's gonna know. Scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show. They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break, they'll hear me pleading, I'll say for God's sake, over and over and over again!",
"Here come the bad news, open the floodgates. They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates, over and over and over again.",
"So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair. They'll have us hung in the air, and tell me what do they care? It's only a life to be twisted and broken.",
"Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times, and no-one really knows the truth from the lies, and in the end the story deeper must hide--deeper and deeper and deeper inside...",
"My lady understands, understands me, right. She understands me...",
"My baby cares, she really cares--she knows what's really right for me, does me good then she hurts me so, she winds me up then lets me go, turns me on and then tells me no. She's just a pussy cat.",
"My baby loves me--my baby cuffs me, one day she tells me that she cares, another day she tells me she don't love me. She really really does me.",
"What is there left for me to do in this life? Did I achieve what I had set in my sights? Am I a happy man, or is this sinking sand? Was it all worth it, was it all worth it?",
"Was it all worth it, giving all my heart and soul and staying up all night? Was it all worth it, living breathing rock 'n' roll, a godforsaken life? Was it all worth it, was it all worth it all these years?",
"Put down our money without counting the cost--it didn't matter if we won, if we lost. Yes, we were vicious, yes, we could kill--yes, we were hungry, yes, we were brill.",
"We served a purpose, like a bloody circus. We were so dandy, we love you madly!",
"While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand, while the waves crash in the sea and meet the land, while there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow, till the mountains crumble into the plain--oh yes, we'll keep on tryin'...",
"While we leave according to race, colour or creed, while we rule by blind madness and pure greed, our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion, through the eons, and on and on--oh yes, we'll keep on tryin', we'll tread that fine line, oh, oh, we'll keep on tryin' till the end of time!",
"Through the sorrow, all through our splendour...don't take offense at my innuendo.",
"You can be anything you want to be: just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be. Be free with your tempo, be free, be free, surrender your ego--be free, be free to yourself!",
"If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky--if there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die, if there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask: show yourself, destroy our fears, release your mask!",
"Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah, and whatever will be, will be. We'll just keep on trying...",
"When the outside temperature rises and the meaning is oh so clear, one thousand and one yellow daffodils begin to dance in front of you...oh, dear! Are they trying to tell you something?",
"I'm one card short of a full deck. I'm not quite the shilling. One wave short of a shipwreck--I'm not my usual top billing. I'm coming down with a fever, I'm really out to sea. This kettle is boiling over--I think I'm a banana tree. Oh dear! I'm going slightly mad.",
"I'm knitting with only one needle, unravelling fast, it's true. I'm driving only three wheels these days--but, my dear, how about you?",
"He used to be a man with a stick in his hand--hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do. She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand--hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do. Now you've got soup in the laundry bag, now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag!",
"You're gettin' in a fight, then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night: let me out of this cheap 'B' movie!",
"It ain't no time to figure wrong from right cause reason's out the window, better hold on tight!",
"I can't live with you, but I can't live without you--I can't let you stay, but I can't live if you go away. I don't know just how it goes--all I know is I can't live with you.",
"I'm having a hard time, I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair. You may think that I don't care, but I travelled a long road to get a hold of my sorrow. I tried to catch a dream, but nothing's what it seems!",
"Love is saying baby, it's all right, when deep inside you're really petrified.",
"We're stuck in a bad place, we're trapped in a rat race, and we can't escape. Maybe there's been some mistake.",
"We're trying to make a high score, we're walking through a closed door, and nobody's winning--we're just sinning against ourselves!",
"Through the madness, through the tears--we've still got each other for a million years.",
"If you're searching out for something--don't try so hard. If you're feeling kinda nothing--don't try so hard. When your problems seem like mountains, you feel the need to find some answers--you can leave them for another day, don't try so hard.",
"But if you fall and take a tumble--it won't be far. If you fail you mustn't grumble--thank your lucky stars. Just savour every mouthful and treasure every moment. When the storms are raging round you, stay right where you are.",
"Oh, don't try so hard! Oh, don't take it all to heart. It's only fools--they make these rules.",
"Get your head down baby--we're gonna ride tonight. Your angel eyes are shining bright. I wanna take your hand, lead you from this place. Gonna leave it all behind, check out of this rat race!",
"Tie your hair back, baby--we're gonna ride tonight. We got freaks to the left, we got jerks to the right. Sometimes I get so low, I just have to ride--let me take your hand, let me be your guide.",
"Thank God you people give freely--don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord!",
"Rule with your heart, live with your conscience, love, love, love, love and be free--we're all God's people!",
"Sometimes I get to feelin' I was back in the old days, long ago, when we were kids, when we were young...things seemed so perfect, you know? The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young. The sun was always shinin'--we just lived for fun. Sometimes it seems like lately, I just don't know, the rest of my life's been...just a show.",
"Those were the days of our lives. The bad things in life were so few. Those days are all gone now but one thing is true: when I look and I find I still love you.",
"You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide--ain't that a shame? I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride when life was just a game.",
"You get away with murder, so innocent, but when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite--that's alright!",
"I'm the hitman, I want your life. Ain't no escaping--don't run and hide. There goes the neighbourhood--I'm gonna kill for your love!",
"You and me are destined, you'll agree, to spend the rest of our lives with each other, the rest of our days like two lovers, forever, yeah, forever, my bijou...",
"Empty spaces--what are we living for? Abandoned places--I guess we know the score.",
"Another hero, another mindless crime, behind the curtain, in the pantomime--hold the line! Does anybody want to take it anymore?",
"The show must go on! Inside my heart is breaking, my make-up may be flaking, but my smile still stays on.",
"Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance. Another heartache, another failed romance--on and on, does anybody know what we are living for?",
"Outside the dawn is breaking, but inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.",
"My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies. Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die--I can fly, my friends!",
"It's a beautiful day--the sun is shining, I feel good, and no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah.",
"Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad, but no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one! It's hopeless, so hopeless to even try.",
"I'm taking my ride with destiny, willing to play my part, living with painful memories, loving with all my heart. Made in heaven, made in heaven, it was all meant to be, yeah.",
"I'm having to learn to pay the price, they're turning me upside down. Waiting for possibilities--don't see too many around.",
"When stormy weather comes around, it was made in heaven. When sunny skies break through behind the clouds, I wish it could last forever, yeah...",
"I'm playing my role in history, looking to find my goal, taking in all this misery, but giving it all my soul.",
"Why don't you take another little piece of my heart? Why don't you take it and break it and tear it all apart? All I do is give, all you do is take. Baby, why don't you give me a brand new start?",
"I don't want a stormy affair to make me feel my life is heading somewhere. All I want is the comfort and care, just to know that my woman gives me sweet Mother Love.",
"I've walked too long in this lonely lane. I've had enough of this same old game. I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong, but my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone.",
"Out in the city, in the cold world outside--I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide. Mama please, let me back inside!",
"I read it in the papers--there's death on every page. Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above: my life has been saved.",
"We're right back where we started from--people going separate ways. This is the way things are now--in disarray.",
"You are the one for me, I am the man for you, you were made for me, you're my ecstasy! If I was given every opportunity, I'd kill for your love.",
"So take a chance with me, let me romance with you! I'm caught in a dream and my dream's come true. It's so hard to believe this is happening to me--an amazing feeling comin' through...",
"This could be heaven for everyone--this world could be fed, this world could be fun. This could be heaven for everyone--this world could be free, this world could be one.",
"This world should be free, this world could be one. We should bring love to our daughters and sons--love, love, love, this could be heaven for everyone.",
"Listen: what people do to other souls, they take their lives, destroy their goals. Their basic pride and dignity is stripped and torn and shown no pity, when this should be heaven for everyone.",
"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be--too many bitter tears are raining down on me. I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone for much too long.",
"I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me about growing up and what a struggle it would be. In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find where I went wrong.",
"Too much love will kill you if you can't make up your mind--torn between the lover and the love you leave behind, you're headed for disaster 'cos you never read the signs--too much love will kill you every time.",
"I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be, and it seems like there's no way out of this for me. I used to bring you sunshine, now all I ever do is bring you down. How would it be if you were standing in my shoes? Can't you see that it's impossible to choose? No, there's no making sense of it--every way I go, I'm bound to lose.",
"Too much love will kill you just as sure as none at all, it'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl, and the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime--too much love will kill you every time.",
"You don't fool me--those pretty eyes, yhat sexy smile. You don't fool me. You don't rule me--you're no surprise. You're telling lies--you don't fool me.",
"Mmm, mama said be careful of that girl! Mama said you know that she's no good. Mama said be cool, don't you be no fool!",
"So quiet and peaceful, tranquil and blissful...there's a kind of magic in the air. What a truly magnificent view! A breathtaking scene--with the dreams of the world in the palm of your hand...",
"What an extraordinary place! And the dream of the child is the hope of the man...",
"Am I dreaming...am I dreaming...? Oooh--it's bliss."],
"quote":["You have to believe in yourself, no matter how long it takes.","If you like the icing on top, and all the trimmings, you've got to have the confidence to go get it.","Labels are as bad as they are good, and if you took them seriously you'd be very silly.","There will always be someone new on the scene, a new face after you and your success, and that challenge is good.","Success can bring problems you have never really bargained for, ones you think can never exist.","Buying people little things is so nice to do. Those little moments make their day; a little gift, a gesture, a nuance, just a little treasure.","Anybody that's successful for long has to take a little bit of flak. It makes them better. You can't be a goody-two-shoes forever.","I don't know what the answer is. You just have to try to do your best.","There's no such thing as an easy climb to success - or an escalator to the top.","Sometimes I think there must be more to life than rushing round the world like a mad thing.","Like I've said before, I think that in the end being natural and being genuine is what wins.","If one starts saying, 'Maybe I'm not good enough, maybe I'd better settle for second place,' then forget it.","A lot of people are creative, in their own way. It doesn't have to be just in music. That is part of talent as well - do you see dears?","You see, loneliness doesn't just mean shut off in a room by yourself, it can be that you're in a crowded area but still be the most lonely person, and that's the most hurtful thing.","Money may be vulgar, but it's wonderful.","I've always thought, 'My God! Don't take yourself so seriously.'","I think love and the lack of love is always going to go on, and there are so many different ways that people fall in and out of love.","Having talent is one thing, but to actually use it and feed it to the masses, is another part of talent. It goes hand in hand. It's called Hard Sell I think.","Sometimes you can be a very strong person and you can build things up, against all odds, and it takes one tiny little thing, and that little four letter word can send you cart-wheeling back.","Sometimes the strongest people can suddenly just collapse. It's like you've blown up a balloon and one prick can make it go, whoosh!","I'm not going to be a star, I'm going to be a legend!","I'm not the leader of the band, by the way. Everybody calls me the leader of Queen, but I'm just the lead singer. I'm not the General, or anything like that. We are all four equal people.","The one thing that keeps me going is that I like to laugh at myself.","I could cause a riot if I wanted to. You suddenly think, 'I've got all this power. I can destroy!' The adrenalin's there, you feel like the devil and it's wonderful, absolutely wonderful. But I know in myself that I would never misuse it.","I don't go on stage every night thinking, 'Wow! I've got that power.' I'm too wonderful for that, darlings!","I'm just a musical tart! That's my nature, but that's not what I'm like in real life.","My character is built up of all kinds of ingredients and the Freddie on stage is just one element of me.","This thing about me living a life of excess is so blown out of proportion.","I'd like to feel that I'm being my honest self and I don't give a shit about what other people say.","I think mystique, not knowing the truth about someone, is very appealing, and the last thing I want to do is give people an idea of who I actually am.","Of course I'm outrageous, camp, theatrical and dramatic, but I haven't CHOSEN that image. I am myself, and in fact half the time I let the wind take me.","Being the support act was one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.","The thing I'm most proud of, of all, is the fact that I'm still around after all this time. That takes the cake to be honest!","I like to try everything once and I'm not scared of pitfalls.","Politics isn't my thing at all. I'd ruin a country. Can you imagine it? I'd sing all my speeches!","You have to fight. I like to add my two penn'orth, dears. If it was made too easy for me I would come up withy lesser material.","You have to fight. I think that's the best way. I like to fight for the very best we can achieve, and I think I make everyone else fight as well. It makes it much more interesting.","I don't believe in half measures or compromise. I just can't bear to compromise about anything. I give everything I've got because that's the way I am.","I'm a man of extremes and that can be very destructive. I can be very over-emotional and that can be a very destructive trait in me too.","I have this hard, macho shell which I project on stage but there's a much softer side too, which melts like butter.","I want a challenge. I always want it that way. I think my system is just conditioned to that. The moment it gets too nice, I become bored. I spoil it for myself.","It would destroy all the mystery if I always explained everything about myself.","I'm a human being. I'd like people to recognise the fact that I'm a human being.","I feel like I'm walking around with scars all over the place and I just think I couldn't take another scar.","You can seem to have everything, and yet have nothing. Maybe one day I'll catch up with myself and that will be my downfall.","I want to have my cake and eat it too. I want my security but I also want my freedom.","I'm not built to be a family man. I'm much too restless and highly strung for that.","Most of the stuff I do is pretending. It's like acting ... I go on stage and pretend to be a macho man and all those things.","I think I get on with most people. I'm sure I'd even get on with King Kong very well. We're the same age. Mind you, I've climbed higher buildings than that!","You don't have to identify with poverty on that level to give money or to help people. Why should you? Sometimes it is very black and white. Some people have money and they want to help the ones in need.","There are times when I wake up in the morning and I think, 'My God, I wish I wasn't Freddie Mercury today!'","For me, happiness is the most important thing, and if I'm happy then it shows in my work.","Just buying somebody a gift is wonderful, but at the same time performing to an audience fulfils me. I wouldn't be in this business if I didn't like it.","Now I'm not scared to do what I want to do and I'm not worried if I make a fool of myself. If I fall into a dustbin, which I have done many times, I don't worry about the fact, if I'm having a good time.","Boredom and dullness are the biggest diseases in the whole world, dears. You can never say that life with me is boring. Excess is a part of my nature and I really need danger and excitement.","Each day is different to me and I look forward to that because I don't want to be the same person every day.","People think I'm a real ... it starts with 'C', but I can't say that ... and it's not a cherub!","I'm very hard to deal with and, to some people, I'm a bitch. I actually enjoy being a bitch. I enjoy being surrounded by bitches.","I'm very hard on the exterior but very soft-centred, like a chocolate - something out of Black Magic.","I wore costumes and put myself in different atmospheres and characters, but underneath that there is a real me.","I like to ridicule myself and I don't take myself too seriously. I wouldn't wear these clothes if I was serious. The one thing that keeps me going is that I like to laugh at myself.","I have all kinds of paranoia. Being alone is one.","Everyone has their moments, putting on airs and graces. I mean, I never tie my own shoe laces. Never. It's just not the done thing in rock'n'roll.","My dears, I'm the vainest creature going.","I've always wanted to be my own boss and I always felt that I knew best. It sounds very precocious, but I knew what I wanted. And if it all ended tomorrow, I would do it all again on my own terms.","I'm in it for the challenge. I don't want it made too easy for me and nobody hands it to me on a silver platter. I'd hate that. And I'd refuse it anyway.","I never try to self-analyse myself, I hate that kind of thing and I don't even like having my palm read.","I like to find out for myself. It would be so boring if I found out what was going to happen to me because then I'd spend my entire life trying to avoid it.","I don't think I would be a car mechanic, and I'm useless at adding up sums and things like that. As far as science is concerned, I'm rubbish, and I'm not a handyman ... oh no. I'm a useless bugger!","I live for tomorrow. Fuck today, it's tomorrow.","I'm not going to listen to people telling me how I should react. Nobody tells me what to do.","I don't think of myself as a legend. Me and legends don't get on. I'm just a little sweetheart ... I'm a sweetie.","I'm a city person. I'm not into all this country air and cow dung!","I don't want to have to shut myself up and hide. That's not what I want. I'd go spare. I'd go mad ... even quicker.","I like to be surrounded by splendid things. I want to lead the Victorian life, surrounded by exquisite clutter.","I cope with wealth very well, actually - I spend, spend, spend. Well, what's money for if not to spend?","All I wanted from life was to make lots of money and spend it.","I always knew I would be a star, and now the rest of the world seems to agree with me.","The higher I climb up the ladder, the bigger the barrier becomes around me. The more I open up the more I get hurt.","I just love being lavish and extravagant. It's such fun.","I'm a rock star, I'm very rich, I can buy anything that I like - including you!","I love buying gifts for people. That's the biggest thrill. I find that's the biggest fun.","I like living life to the full. That's my nature, and I'm just not going to conform or listen to people about how I should react. I do what I want to do.","I'll always walk round like a Persian Popinjay and no-one's going to stop me. Nobody tells me what to do.","I think I've earned my keep. I worked hard for what I've got and I value that more than anything.","I could be penniless tomorrow and if I lost everything tomorrow, I'd claw my way back to the top somehow.","I don't care what journalists say. What do they know? Fuck them if they just don't get it!","When you've tasted success as beautifully as I have, you don't want to let it go in a hurry.","I want to do different things. I don't want to keep to the same formula over and over again, otherwise you just go insane.","I love challenge and I love doing things that are not part of the mainstream.","I could become a gardener, actually. So many things happen in my garden.","No-one is ever going to tell me I've had my day, had my innings, now do something else.","If I want to try different things - walk a tightrope, live a knife-edge - and do things where if I fall completely flat on my face and do things which are harmful to my career, so what? I will.","Nobody could take the piss out of me as much as I take the piss out of myself.","I don't regret too many decisions I made. I look upon some of the things I did with disgust and of course think, 'My God, how could I have done that?' but I must say, over all, I will stand by most of the decisions I've taken.","I've had upheavals and I've had immense problems, but I've had a wonderful time and I have no regrets.","I'm just a musical prostitute dears!","If I had to do it all again? Yes. Why not? I might do some of it slightly differently. I have no regrets.","Some people can take second best, but I can't. I look upon it as a defeat. If you've got the taste of being number one, then number two isn't good enough.","I love the fact that I make people happy, in any form. Even if it's just half an hour of their lives, in any way that I can make them feel lucky or make them feel good, or bring a smile to a sour face, that to me is worthwhile.","I really don't want to change the world. To me happiness is the most important thing - to be happy and to have fun.","Will I get to heaven? No. I don't want to. Hell is much better. Look at all the interesting people you're going to meet down there!","You can seem to have everything, and yet have nothing. Maybe one day I'll catch up with myself and that will be my downfall.","It could all end tomorrow. I'm not afraid of it. It's a precarious life but I think I like it that way. I like it a little risky.","It isn't that I wanted to be tough and vicious, it's something that is forced upon you. Once you are successful all the baddies move in and that is when you've got to be really strong and try and sift them out - and that is a test of survival really.","I fall in love far too quickly and end up getting hurt all the time. Maybe I just draw the wrong kind of people to me?","I've got scars all over. But I can't help myself because basically I'm a softie.","I seem to eat people up when they get too close and destroy them, no matter how hard I try to make things work.","There must be a destructive element in me because I try very hard to build up relationships but somehow I drive people away.","Sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat, in fear because I'm alone. That's why I go out looking for someone who will love me, even if it's just for a one night stand.","What I really like is a lot of loving. I fall in love and then I end up getting hurt and scarred. It seems I just can't win.","In one way I think the more mishaps I have, the better the songs I write are going to be. Once I find somebody, find a long-lasting relationship, bang goes all the research for wonderful songs!","I have maybe a wider sexual taste than most people, but that's as far as I'm going to go.","I've been let down many times, but I just grit my teeth, bite my tongue and say, 'Fuck 'em!'","I'm possessed by love! Isn't everybody?","Success has brought me millions of pounds, and worldwide adulation, but not the thing we all need - a loving relationship. You can be loved by so many thousands of people, yet still be the most loneliest person.","I think love always comes first, but love can let you down. You have to be so damn strong. Love can ruin everything that you've built up, if you let it. I suppose you have to be a hard-faced bitch.","We're not just trying to be different, because if you're professional, darlings, you don't have to *try* to be anything!","I'll sing until my throat is like a vulture's crotch.","I always want to play to as many people as possible. The bigger the better!","I hate actually trying to analyse my songs to the full. You should never ask me about my lyrics.","It's hard to explain but there are always various ideas going through my head. Certain things just come together, but others I have to work for.","I've been known to scribble down lyrics in the middle of the night without even putting the light on.","I'm always thinking about the new songs I'm writing. I can't stop writing new songs. I have a lot of ideas bursting to get out.","I just like to write nice little catchy tunes. It's just something that I have to keep doing, but I do enjoy it too. It's a kind of hobby in a funny way.","I think most people write songs that are inside them.","Most of the songs I write are love ballads and things to do with sadness and torture and pain, but at the same time it's frivolous and tongue-in-cheek. That's basically whole nature, I guess. I'm just a true romantic...","A lot of people have fallen in love and a lot of people have fallen out of love, and people are still doing it, so I'm still writing songs about that...","Inspiration strikes anywhere. It strikes when I'm least expecting it and it plays havoc with my sex life.","My songs are like Bic razors; they're for fun, for modern consumption. People can discard them like a used tissue afterwards.","Music is limitless. I'd like the whole world to listen to my music. I'm not an elitist.","I will say no more than what any decent poet would tell you if you dared ask him to analyse his work. If you see it, dears, then it's there.","Is it still possible to write good and original songs? Oh I should bloody well think so!","If my music makes people happy, that's a wonderful thing. That makes me very happy.","I never like to repeat the same formula more than once because I find it boring. I'm always looking for something different which is good because that's a challenge.","A lot of my songs are fantasy, I can dream up all kinds of things."],
